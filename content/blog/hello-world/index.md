<!--
As I'm currently starting a new job, I feel like the time is right to start a blog. I've been trying to start it for years at this point. It has been forgotten over and over 
again. The problem has been a lack of topics to write about. That brings me back to why starting a new job will be a good thing - should be plenty to write about. 
-->

If you are reading this; this post is not for you. This is me getting started with writing for this blog and trying to convince myself that it's a good idea.

## Motivation 

<!-- Why does this blog exist? -->

### Improving my writing skills ✍️ 

### Sharing my ideas with other people 😆

### Building a personal brand 📈
