Projects included a discussion forum, a beat analyzer connected to LEDs and a functional ransomware.{' '}\n        </p>\n        {/* <p>\n          In 2017 I started studying Computer Engineering at NTNU. I took extra courses on low level programming and machine learning. A lot\n          of time went into starting Recrut, a HR start-up. Using Django and React, we successfully launched our platform and got a lot of\n          students at our university onboard, as well as some of cool companies - including Spacemaker (recently got aquired for 240M) and\n          Cognite (just raised a round with Accel for 550M). In 2019 Highered aquired the company and our team went on to re-build their\n          platform. The platform is used by over 250,000 students. In 2020 I started Favn, with the goal of quickly building a profitable\n          start-up building software. Favn is currently profitable with 17 part-time employees and has helped multiple other start-ups get\n          off the ground. I also participated in hackathons and competitive programming competitions.\n        </p> */}\n        <p>Since September 2020 I have worked at Palantir as Forward Deployed Software Engineer based in London.</p>\n      </Container>\n    </Page>\n  </IndexLayout>\n)\n\nexport default PageTwo\n","import * as React from 'react'\nimport { Link, graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby'\n\nimport Container from '../components/Container'\nimport { colors } from '../styles/variables'\n\nimport Img from 'gatsby-image'\n\ninterface FeatureProps {\n  image?: boolean\n}\n\nconst Feature: React.FC<FeatureProps> = ({ image, children }) => {\n  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`\n    query {\n      file(relativePath: { eq: \"profile-no-background.png\" }) {\n        childImageSharp {\n          fixed(width: 300, height: 300) {\n            ...GatsbyImageSharpFixed\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  `)\n  return (\n    <div style={{ backgroundColor: colors.gray.dark }}>\n      <Container>\n        <div style={{ display: 'flex', paddingTop: 50, minHeight: 300 }}>{children}</div>\n      </Container>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Feature\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
