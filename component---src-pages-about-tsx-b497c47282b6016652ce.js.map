Projects included a discussion forum, a beat analyzer connected to LEDs and a functional ransomware.{' '}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In 2017 I started studying Computer Engineering at NTNU. I took extra courses on low level programming and machine learning. A lot\n          of time went into starting Recrut, a HR start-up. Using Django and React, we successfully launched our platform and got a lot of\n          students at our university onboard, as well as some of cool companies - including Spacemaker (recently got aquired for 240M) and\n          Cognite (just raised a round with Accel for 550M). In 2019 Highered aquired the company and our team went on to re-build their\n          platform. The platform is used by over 250,000 students. In 2020 I started Favn, with the goal of quickly building a profitable\n          start-up building software. Favn is currently profitable with 17 part-time employees and has helped multiple other start-ups get\n          off the ground. I also participated in hackathons and competitive programming competitions.\n        </p>\n        <p>Since September 2020 I have worked at Palantir as Forward Deployed Software Engineer based in London.</p>\n      </Container>\n    </Page>\n  </IndexLayout>\n)\n\nexport default PageTwo\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
